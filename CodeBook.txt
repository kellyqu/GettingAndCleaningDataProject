This code book summarizes the resulting data fields in  mytidy.txt  file. 
It is a data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Identifiers
• subject  - The ID of the subjects - there are in total 30 subjects from combined "test" and "train" observations
• activity  - The type of activity performed for each measurement with below labels. 

Activity Labels 
• WALKING  as of value  1 
• WALKING_UPSTAIRS  as value  2  
• WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS  as of value  3 
• SITTING  as of value  4 
• STANDING  as of value 5 
• LAYING  as of value 6
